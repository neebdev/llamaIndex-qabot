For example, the name you choose cannot be identical or almost identical or too similar to another company name that is already reserved or registered in ADGM. It cannot be offensive or contain certain words that are restricted or protected by other name rules.
To ensure your chosen name is not the ‘same as’ or identical to an existing name of any company, conduct a search in ADGM Companies Register. You should also check existing trademarks by contacting the Ministry of Economy and/or similar office in other jurisdictions to ensure that the proposed name does not infringe an existing trade.
For more information on words that are offensive or restrictive, please refer to Business and Company Name Rules 2015 (coming 15 June).
